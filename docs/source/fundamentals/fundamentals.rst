"There is more than one way to do it." *--Tim Toady*

Tim Toady is not a real person, but rather the pronunciation of the motto above, which is usually associated with the Perl language, and taken to be somewhat in opposition to the Python ethos. Not that Python is above giving one many gauges and colours of rope to hang oneself with -- think of list comprehensions versus ``map``/``filter``/``reduce`` versus good old-fashioned for-loops.

Stimela (in its second, reborn version) is fairly new and we the developers are also the front-line users. We are still learning how to use it best. One day, we will hopefully have a comprehensive set of :ref:`best_practices` to guide the newbies. For now, keep Tim Towdy in mind as you read the below. 

"There is more than one way to skin a cat." *--traditional, with no disrespect meant to cats. Even if a cat might be entitled to disagree.*
