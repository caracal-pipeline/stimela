Cherry-picking steps; skips and tags
####################################


Cherry-picking steps from the command line
------------------------------------------

The ``-s/--step`` option to ``stimela run`` allows one to selectively run part of the recipe. This option expects one or more step labels (comma-separated, or alternatively multiple ``--step`` options can be given), or a step *range* specified as ``start:end`` (or ``:end``, or ``start:``. Note that ``end`` is inclusive.) Only the specified step(s) are then run. 

The 'skip' attribute
--------------------

Recipe steps can have an optional ``skip`` attribute. This can be set to ``true`` (a.k.a. a hard-skip), or can employ :ref:`subst` for a *conditional skip* that is evaluated at runtime. If the formula or substitution of the conditional skip evaluates to non-zero (or a non-empty string), the step is skipped.

Hard-skips are mainly useful for steps that are only intended to be invoked manually (think of dev-workflows with expensive or experimental one-off steps). A hard-skip step can only ever be invoked via the ``-s/--step`` option.

The ``skip_if_outputs`` attribute provides a way to skip steps based on the state of their (file-type) outputs. Setting ``skip_if_outputs: exist`` will cause a step to be skipped if all its file-type outputs already exist. Setting ``skip_if_outputs: fresh`` will cause a step to be skipped if all its file-type outputs are "fresh", i.e. are not older than any file-type inputs (this works similar to old-school Makefiles). 


Tags
-----

Tags provide a way of grouping related steps together, and running or skipping them as a group. Tags are inspired by Ansible (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_tags.html). 

A step can have an optional ``tags`` attribute, giving a list of one or more arbitrary text labels. Two tags with special meaning are  ``never`` and ``always``. The following rules then apply:

* Invoking the recipe as ``stimela run --tags foo`` tells stimela to run only the steps that have a ``foo`` or ``always`` tag.   
* Conversely, ``--skip-tags foo`` tells stimela to run all steps, except those with a ``foo`` or ``never`` tag. 
* If no ``--tags`` or ``--skip-tags`` option is given, steps tagged with ``never`` are skipped.

Another way of putting this is, steps tagged as ``[foo,never]`` can only be invoked by running with ``--tags foo``, while steps tagged as ``always`` are run regardless of any ``--tags`` given.

Note that if a **single** step (as opposed to a step range) is given to the ``-s/--step`` option, that step is explicitly enabled, regardless of its tags or skip attributes. Thus, ``tags: [never]`` has the same effect as a hard-skip.
