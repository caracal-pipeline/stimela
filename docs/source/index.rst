Stimela2
=========

Stimela2 is a workflow management framework for creating portable and reproducible data processing pipelines.

Please refer to our `reference paper <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ascom.2025.100959>`_ for an overview of Stimela2. Throughout these documentation pages, we use "Stimela" and "Stimela2" interchangeably to refer to Stimela versions 2.x. Note that the 2.x framework is very different from `Stimela 1.x ("Classic") <https://github.com/ratt-ru/Stimela-classic>`_, which we do not discuss further here.
